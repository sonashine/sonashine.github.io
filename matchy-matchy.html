<p>A mini game wherein an invader is moving from the right-hand side of the screen towards a base on the left-hand side. The player has the ability to shoot down the invader with a shape-shifting cannon.</p>
<p>The base contains a cannon that can morph between various forms. 
    The cannon begins as a randomly selected shape from those three and when the user presses the <b>'f'</b> key, the cannon switches to the next shapes. 
    The user can fire this cannon at the invader by pressing the<b>'j'</b> key. 
<p>If the cannon is the same shape as the invader when fired, then it obliterates the incoming invader, making it disappear.</p>
<p> If the user has successfully shot an invader, it disappears and a new one appears on the right-hand side of the screen. </p>
<p> That invader also moves towards the base, just as the first one did. </p>
<p>If the invader reaches the red base, the game is over and whole screen goes a bright red.</p>
<p> If the user hits the <b>'j'</b> key to fire the cannon but the cannon does not match the shape of the invader, then the base will grow by 115 pixels, making it more likely the invader will reach the base.</p>
