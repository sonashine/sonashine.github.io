<p>Here are my Projects:</p>

<h3><a href = "http://sonashine.github.io/projects/Bank%20Loan%20Approval%20Using%20Artificial%20Neural%20Nets.html">
Bank Loan Approval Using Artificial Neural Nets</a></h3>
<p>A Multi-Layer Neural Network model which predicts the approval of personal loans for bank customers based on demographic factors such as age, experience, income, education, and existing mortgage with 97% accuracy using Keras with TensorFlow 2.0 as a backend.</p>
<p>Assessed the performance of the model and ensure its generalisation using various Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as precision, recall, and accuracy.</p>
</p>


<h3><a href = "http://sonashine.github.io/projects/Project%20Predicting%20stock%20prices.html">Predicting Tesla Stock Prices</a></h3>
<p>Built a Linear Regression Model with SKLearn, loaded and analysed Stock Price data to predict Tesla’s stock prices in the future.</p>

<h3>Matchy-Matchy</h3>
<p>Coded in Processing 3.0 | Java for an Introductory Computing Unit.</p>
<p>A mini game wherein an invader is moving from the right-hand side of the screen towards a base on the left-hand side. The player has the ability to shoot down the invader with a shape-shifting cannon.</p>
<p>Received a 100% grade for the first iteration of the project and 90% for the second iteration.</p>
