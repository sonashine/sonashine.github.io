<p>Here are my Projects:</p>

<h3><a href = "http://sonashine.github.io/projects/Bank%20Loan%20Approval%20Using%20Artificial%20Neural%20Nets.html">
Bank Loan Approval Using Artificial Neural Nets</a></h3>
<p>A Multi-Layer Neural Network model which predicts the approval of personal loans for bank customers based on demographic factors such as age, experience, income, education, and existing mortgage with 97% accuracy using Keras with TensorFlow 2.0 as a backend.</p>
<p>Assessed the performance of the model and ensure its generalisation using various Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as precision, recall, and accuracy.</p>
</p>


<h3><a href = "http://sonashine.github.io/projects/Project%20Predicting%20stock%20prices.html">Predicting Tesla Stock Prices</a></h3>
<p>Built a Linear Regression Model with SKLearn, loaded and analysed Stock Price data to predict Tesla’s stock prices in the future.</p>

<canvas data-processing-sources="matchy-matchy.pde"></canvas>
<p>Coded in Processing 3.0 | Java for an Introductory Computing Unit.</p>
<p>A mini game wherein an invader is moving from the right-hand side of the screen towards a base on the left-hand side. The player has the ability to shoot down the invader with a shape-shifting cannon.</p>
<p>The base contains a cannon that can morph between various forms. The cannon begins as a randomly selected shape from those three and when the user presses the 'f' key, the cannon switches to the next shapes. The user can fire this cannon at the invader by pressing 'j'. If the cannon is the same shape as the invader when fired, then it obliterates the incoming invader, making it disappear.
    If the user has successfully shot an invader, it disappears and a new one appears on the right-hand side of the screen. That invader also moves towards the base, just as the first one did. If the invader reaches the red base, the game is over and whole screen goes a bright red.
    If the user hits the 'j' key to fire the cannon but the cannon does not match the shape of the invader, then the base will grow by 115 pixels, making it more likely the invader will reach the base.</p>
<p>Received a 100% grade, ranking First out of 331 students.</p>

<h3>Matchy Matchy 2.0</h3>
<canvas data-processing-sources="matchy-matchy-2.0.pde"></canvas>
<p>Built on top of Matchy-Matchy, the invader and the cannon have transformed from shapes to digits.</p>
<p>  When the user presses the 'f' key, the cannon switches to the next digit. To fire the cannon, the user presses the 'j' key and the left-most matching invader is obliterated.</p> 
 <p>   Every time an invader gets obliterated, the player gets five points. Points are silently accumulated until the game is over. When an invader reaches the danger zone, the game stops and displays the score. The screen no longer goes red, it just displays the score on the right hand side of the screen.
    As the one invader moves to the left, new invaders come in behind it. A new invader should appear as soon as the first one is 70pixels to the left. Every 70 pixels that the invaders move, another appears to the right. When the cannon is fired, the left-most matching invader is obliterated. To obliterate more than one of the same number you have to hit 'j' multiple times. Every time an invader is obliterated, the space it occupied is taken up by the invader to its left. i.e. obliterating an invader causes all the invaders to the left of it to move rightwards into the empty space.</p>
